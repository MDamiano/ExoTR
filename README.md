# ExoTR

Version 1.2.0

A fully Bayesian inverse retrieval algorithm to interpret exoplanetary transmission spectra.

Includes:
* A generation of transmission spectra routine;
* A retrieval routine based on nested sampling (i.e. MultiNest).

## Authors
* Mario Damiano (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology)
* Renyu Hu (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology)

## Collaborators
* Armen Tokadjian (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology)
* Audrey DeVault (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)

## Installation:
Download the .zip file from Github, unzip it and place it in a folder at your preference. 
Therefore, make the folder searchable for python in your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` depending on your system

`export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/full/path/of/folder/containing/ExoTR:"`

Download the folder "Data" from the following link : [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yXtKIHfsHfCrS9kJef0ycjK1zOvz2vXx?usp=share_link) .
Place the downloaded "Data" folder inside the ExoTR folder.

## Usage
You have to prepare the "retrieval_example.dat" and "forward_example.dat" parameters files before running ExoTR. Refer to the examples provided for guidance.
The full list of possible parameters are listed in the "standard_parameters.dat" file, placed inside the ExoTR package. Do not modify the "standard_parameters.dat" file.

You can generate a transmission spectrum by typing in a python instance or script.py file the following lines:

`import ExoTR`

`spec = ExoTR.CREATE_SPECTRUM()`

`spec.run_forward('forward_example.dat')`

You can run a retrieval by typing in a python instance or script.py file the following lines:

`import ExoTR`

`ret = ExoTR.RETRIEVAL()`

`ret.run_retrieval('retrieval_example.dat')`

To run the retrieval mode you need to have the MultiNest libraries installed in your system as well as `pymultinest (v2.11)`.

`pymultinest` is MPI compatible, therefore, you can run ExoTR to perform the sampling of the retrieval in parallel (you will need to install `mpi4py`):

`mpirun -np 10 python exotr_retrieval.py`

## Plotting the results
The plotting of the retrieval results is automatic and will produce the following graphs:
* Chemistry of the atmosphere versus the atmospheric pressure;
* Mean molecular mass versus the atmospheric pressure;
* The input spectral data and the best fit model calculated by the Bayesian sampling;
* The contribution plot;
* The traces of the fitted free parameters;
* The posterior distribution corner plot.

In case `pymultinest` finds multiple solutions, ExoTR will automatically plot the aforementioned graphs for each of the solutions.
